Just open an [issue](https://github.com/fxrhan/passForge/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/fxrhan/passForge/pulls).  
It's always better to discuss your changes before opening a pull request, be aware if you open a pull request without discuss changes your pull request can be rejected.
